# sysConfig
This is my go to configuration for my home linux devices.
It manages my dot files and keeps the config somewhat unified.

Just run the setup script. The setup script will not remove files from your system. It will only add them and move them over if they already exist.

Only put files in here if you want them shared across all devices.
